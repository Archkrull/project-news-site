# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site or magazine with a logo, navbar and responsive design.

## The problem

I started with looking at already existing web sites such as New York Times and National Geographic to get a sense of the layout and design.

I sketched my own design on a paper, and then used w3schools.com and google extensively to be able to implement the plan.

If I had more time I definetely would have had a better design, as I focused more on function rather than form. Also, as I didn't have enough time, I copied some code without really understanding it to begin with, and I would have liked to be able to break it down and make it my own.
