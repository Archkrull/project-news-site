            <p>Finding the right tree for your home garden can be a challenge. 
            Whether you are looking to add a bit of shade to your property or to screen a view of a neighboring home, trees are often the solution.</p>
            <p>trees can also be used to create a focal point in your garden. Fruit trees are also beautiful and can be grown in orchard fashion or incorporated into your garden. </p>

          <img class="img-2" src="./images/insects.jpg" alt="picture of three different insects">
          <div class="text-box">
            <p>I never thought much about the insects in my garden until I had pepper plants with these little bugs that would move around every time I saw them. 
            I later learned that they were sharpshooters. And sharpshooters suck the life out of your plants by getting in the root system and taking the water from the plant. Not fun!</p>
            <p>Thankfully I was able to get rid of them but I did learn that it is important to know about harmful bugs as well as good bugs. Today we are going to focus on the good bugs.
            Here's a list of insects that you want in your garden and how to get them there without having to purchase them.</p>

          <div class="text-box">
            <p>Besides all the important restorative work that “weeds” do for the soil, this is just a reminder that spring is the very best time to enjoy eating fresh, tender “weeds”.  Fresh in salad, or sauteed in grassfed butter, added to eggs,soup or stir fried dishes, these greens are packed with nutrients that you need.
            These greens know how to “mine” deep into the soil to bring up important minerals & nutrients and make them available to the plant and to YOU!</p>
            <p>Did you know that plantain is found worldwide (there is probably some in your yard right now!) and is a popular wound healer, body purifier, congestion aid and neutralizer of poison and toxic elements?</p>

            <p>Lawns were a European invention, England to be precise, and they were the undertaking of the fabulously wealthy, seeking to bring the glade closer to home.
            Originally, they were cultivated with more useful (though not necessarily used) plants like chamomile or thyme.
            However, the trend moved towards closely cropped grasses, first maintained by grazing sheep then by men with scythes and finally, eventually, moving along (in fast forward) to the suburban land owner with his lawnmower, trimmers, and multitude of weapons against nature. </p>
